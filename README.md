# User Login Script

This is a simple Python script that simulates a user login system. The script verifies a username and password entered during account creation against the credentials provided during login.

## Features
Account Creation: Users can input their username and password for creating an account.
Login Verification: The script ensures the entered login credentials match the account details.
Error Handling: Displays an error message if the login credentials are incorrect.

## How It Works

1. The script prompts the user to create an account by entering a username and password.
2. The user is then prompted to log in using the previously created username and password.
3. If the credentials match, a "Login successful" message is displayed; otherwise, an "Error" message is shown.


## Usage

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Run the script using the command:
   ```bash
   python user_login.py
   ```
3. Follow the prompts to create an account and log in.



## Future Enhancements

- Add password encryption for better security.
- Implement multiple user support.
- Integrate with a database for storing user credentials.
